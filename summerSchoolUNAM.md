> Apply approach

```R
vector <- NULL
for (i=1, 1++, stop = 12050) {
    vector <- c(vector, mean(Table1[i,])
}
                
                
# OR
  apply(count, 1, mean) # 1 for rows and 2 columns
```

```R
apply(counts[1:10, 1:5] != 0, 1, sum)
```



Interactive R
-------------

The easiest way to use R is in its interactive mode. You start R in its interactive mode by simply typing "R" at the command line:

R

You will see how R starts and welcomes you. Each line begins with a ">". In this mode we can "talk" to R. We can ask it some questions, press "Enter" and R will answer us. 

We are going to use many more functions today.
