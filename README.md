# III Summer School in Bioinformatics

Currently, methods introduced in biological research have spread out towards disciplines such as medicine, behavior biology, ecology, information theory, among others. Most scientists working with biological questions find out that to answer them, one must take a systems biology approach to understand the complex processes involved in cell, individual and population evolution as a whole. Currently, researchers are faced with the need to analyze large amounts of raw data, for which they require a fair amount of programming skills.

The **III Summer School in Bioinformatics**, organized by the Institute of Mathematics and the Institute of Neurobiology from UNAM Juriquilla, was placed from **Sunday, June 10th to Sunday, June 24th, 2018 **at the Centro Académico Cultural (CAC), UNAM Juriquilla.

Here, we learned how to use a **Linux** programming environment, besides of hands-on programming and basic data analysis in two leading-edge programming languages: **Python** and **R.** Courses will be taught by experts in the area and will consist of theoretical and practical modules.
